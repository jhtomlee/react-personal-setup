# React Personal Setup

My personal setup for React to be used as template when starting a new project.

## Details

### Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - to run commands or scripts before committing or pushing
- [ ] [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html) - to format code
- [ ] [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) - to find and fix problems in code
- [ ] [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - to run multiple linters (e.g. Prettier and ESLint) against staged git files

### UI Framework
- [ ] [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

### State management
- [ ] [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [ ] [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
